<p>PHP is a loosely typed language , which means when you create a a variable you do not need to specify its data type. But form your coding perspective you need to declare the data types of variables so your code is more easily readable from you and other programmers in your team.</p><p>In simple word, type hinting means providing hints to function to only accept the given data type. In technical word we can say that Type Hinting is a method by which we can force function to accept the desired data type.</p><p>Type hinting" forces you to only pass objects of a particular type. This prevents you from passing incompatible values, and creates a standard if you're working with a team .</p><p>When passing an unexpected type to a function, PHP will attempt to automatically cast the value to the expected type. If strict_types has been declared then PHP will throw an exception instead. Using <strong>declare(strict_types=1)</strong> will tell PHP to throw type errors when you try to (accidentally) cast primitive values.</p>
