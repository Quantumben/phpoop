<p>Interfaces allow you to specify what methods a class should implement. A PHP interface defines a contract which a class must fulfill.</p><p>If a PHP class is a blueprint for objects, an interface is a blueprint for classes.</p><p>Any class implementing a given interface can be expected to have the same behavior in terms of what can be called, how it can be called, and what will be returned.</p><p>Interface is not the implementation of the method. It is just a definition of methods.</p><p>Class is nothing but an implementation of the methods with the properties.</p><p>Interface is just the definition of those methods and it works like a guideline.</p><p>Interface keyword is used to define interfaces and implements keyword is used to implement from an interface.</p><p>If you work in a company the architect may give the interfaces to developers and ask from them to implement the methods, so developers have a guideline that have to follow.</p><p><br></p><p>In PHP we are not able to implement multiple inheritance but in case of interface we can implement multiple interface to one class.</p>
