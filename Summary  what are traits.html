<p>Traits are a mechanism for code reuse in single inheritance languages such as PHP. A Trait is intended to reduce some limitations of single inheritance by enabling a developer to reuse sets of methods freely in several independent classes living in different class hierarchies.</p><p>Traits solve a problem in PHP which is multiple inheritance because we can not extend more than one class.</p><p>To solve this issue we can create a class and use inside it as many traits we want.</p>
