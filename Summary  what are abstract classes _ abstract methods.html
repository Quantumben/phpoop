<p>Abstract class is a class from which we do not want to create an object. We only want to access its methods.</p><p>A class is called abstract when it has at least one abstract method.</p><p>Abstract methods must be defined in the child class.</p><p>We can not create an instance of an abstract class</p><p><br></p><p>Interface are similar to abstract classes. The difference between interfaces and abstract classes are:</p><p>1) Interfaces cannot have properties, while abstract classes can</p><p>2) All interface methods must be public, while abstract class methods is public or protected</p><p>3) All methods in an interface are abstract, so they cannot be implemented in code and the abstract keyword is not necessary</p><p>4) Classes can implement an interface while inheriting from another class at the same time</p>
