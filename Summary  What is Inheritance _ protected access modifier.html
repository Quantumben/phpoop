<p>The main purpose of inheritance is reusability and extendability of your code</p><p>Sharing of code from one class(parent class) to another class(child) is basically the concept of inheritance.</p><p>Inheritance allows a class to reuse the code from another class without duplicating it.In inheritance, you have a <strong>parent</strong> class with properties and methods, and a <strong>child</strong> class can use the code from the parent class. Inheritance allows you to write the code in the parent class and use it in both parent and child classes. The parent class is also called a base class or super class. And the child class is also known as a derived class or a subclass.</p><p>A class can extend another class to reuse its properties and methods so you donâ€™t have to rewrite them.</p><p>The child class will inherit all the public and protected properties and methods from the parent class. In addition, it can have its own properties and methods. An inherited class is defined by using the extends keyword. Unless a class overrides those methods, they will retain their original functionality. Private methods of a parent class are not accessible to a child class.</p><p>When having to use inheritance the best practice is to name each filename after the class name and generally have only one class into each file, but for the purpose of the lesson we will try to put all classes in one file so it makes better sense to you.</p>
